# 30 Days DevOps Challenge - Weather Dashboard

Day 1: Building a weather data collection system using AWS S3 and OpenWeather API

# Weather Data Collection System - DevOps Day 1 Challenge

## Project Overview
This project is a Weather Data Collection System that demonstrates core DevOps principles by combining:
- External API Integration (OpenWeather API)
- Cloud Storage (AWS S3)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Version Control (Git)
- Python Development
- Error Handling
- Environment Management

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities
- Displays temperature (°F), humidity, and weather conditions
- Automatically stores weather data in AWS S3
- Supports multiple cities tracking
- Timestamps all data for historical tracking

## Technical Architecture
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (S3)
- **External API:** OpenWeather API
- **Dependencies:** 
  - boto3 (AWS SDK)
  - python-dotenv
  - requests

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
--bash
git clone https://github.com/ShaeInTheCloud/30days-weather-dashboard.git

3. Install dependencies:
bashCopypip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure environment variables (.env):
CopyOPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name

4.Configure AWS credentials:
bashCopyaws configure

5. Run the application:
python src/weather_dashboard.py

**What I Learned**
- Configuring an IAM user with proper permissions and setting up access keys for AWS CLI.
- Installing and configuring AWS CLI to manage cloud resources directly from VS Code.
- Managing environment variables securely by storing API keys in a `.env` file.
- Setting up Python virtual environments and installing dependencies with `requirements.txt`.
- Working with OpenWeatherMap API by creating an account and integrating its API key.
- Following Git workflows for forking, cloning, and managing projects in VS Code.
- Running Python scripts efficiently and integrating external APIs into projects.

Future Enhancements

Add weather forecasting
Implement data visualization
