# Weather Data Collection System - DevOps Day 1 Challenge

## Project Overview
This project is a Weather Data Collection System that demonstrates core DevOps principles by combining:
- External API Integration (OpenWeather API)
- Cloud Storage (AWS S3)
- Infrastructure as Code
- Version Control (Git)
- Python Development
- Error Handling
- Environment Management

## Features
- Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities
- Displays temperature (Â°F), humidity, and weather conditions
- Automatically stores weather data in AWS S3
- Supports multiple cities tracking
- Timestamps all data for historical tracking

## What I Learned
- Configuring an IAM user with proper permissions and setting up access keys for AWS CLI.
- Installing and configuring AWS CLI to manage cloud resources directly from VS Code.
- Managing environment variables securely by storing API keys in a `.env` file.
- Setting up Python virtual environments and installing dependencies with `requirements.txt`.
- Working with OpenWeatherMap API by creating an account and integrating its API key.
- Following Git workflows for forking, cloning, and managing projects in VS Code.
- Running Python scripts efficiently and integrating external APIs into projects.
