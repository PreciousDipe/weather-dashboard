## Technical Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](https://github.com/PreciousDipe/weather-dashboard/blob/main/src/weather-dashboard.drawio.png)


## Weather Dashboard
This application fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities, displays temperature (Â°F), humidity, and weather conditions and automatically stores weather data in AWS S3. It also Supports multiple cities tracking and Timestamps all data for historical tracking

## What I Learned
- Configuring an IAM user with proper permissions and setting up access keys for AWS CLI.
- Installing and configuring AWS CLI to manage cloud resources directly from VS Code.
- Managing environment variables securely by storing API keys in a `.env` file.
- Setting up Python virtual environments and installing dependencies with `requirements.txt`.
- Working with OpenWeatherMap API by creating an account and integrating its API key.
- Following Git workflows for forking, cloning, and managing projects in VS Code.
- Running Python scripts efficiently and integrating external APIs into projects.
